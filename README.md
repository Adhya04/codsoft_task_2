# codsoft_task_2
Hello everyone,
This project is rather a task that was given to me by my internship provider organisation CODSOFT. i want to thank them for giving me this oppurtunity to showcase my skills.

In this task i have been guven to create a simple calculator using python programming language. In the following task I have used basic funcion operation and nested if else statements and basic add, substract, multiply, and divide arthmatic operations. the following task takes two numbers as input from the user and ask the user which arthematic operation the user wants to perform on the inputed numbers when the user chooses any one of the four options, the program runs the respective function according to the option which the user has chosen and returns the result.
